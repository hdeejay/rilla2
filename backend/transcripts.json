    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sales Representative (Mark)",
      "text": "Hi Lisa! Thanks for taking my call. I’m reaching out because I understand you run an online clothing boutique, and I wanted to see if you’d be interested in learning about how our software can help streamline your inventory management and improve your customer experience."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer (Lisa)",
      "text": "I'm listening. What exactly does your software do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sales Representative (Mark)",
      "text": "Great question! Our software, TechEase Inventory Pro, is designed specifically for small businesses like yours. It helps you keep track of your stock levels in real-time, automatically updates your inventory after every sale, and can even forecast trends based on your sales history. This can save you a lot of time and prevent overselling or running out of popular items."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer (Lisa)",
      "text": "That sounds helpful. I’ve been having some issues with keeping up with inventory, especially when we have big sales. But I already use a platform for my online store. How does your software integrate with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sales Representative (Mark)",
      "text": "I'm glad you brought that up! Our software integrates seamlessly with most major e-commerce platforms, like Shopify, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce. Once integrated, it syncs your inventory data across all channels, ensuring that you have accurate, up-to-date information. This means fewer errors and less manual work on your part."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer (Lisa)",
      "text": "That would definitely be useful. Can it handle multiple locations? We’re thinking about expanding to a second warehouse soon."
